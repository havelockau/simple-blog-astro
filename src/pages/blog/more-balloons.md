## More than just hot wind?

There has been a lot of media speculation and several narratives that surround the Chinese Hot Air Balloon fiasco that was first noticed near the start of February, 2023. Since the identification of the balloon by civilians and the government, the USA have had a strong response. 

More recently we have seen the US identify more aircraft. Last week, the U.S. shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon over the Atlantic Ocean just off South Carolina, after it had spent several days travelling across the country. Following this news, more reports revealed that other Chinese spy balloons had infiltrated U.S. airspace since 2018, yet remained undetected until now. China asserted that the balloon destroyed was simply a weather-monitoring station pushed off course by the wind; however, recovered electronic equipment from the wreckage have suggested otherwise and indicate its use for spying on electronic signals. Additionally, Chinese officials said that the U.S. has conducted similar operations in their country, yet American authorities deny this allegation.

The U.S. has shot down three more airborne objects over the past few days: one off the coast of Alaska on Friday, one over Canada on Saturday, and one over Lake Huron in Michigan on Sunday (even wasting a missile by missing the aircraft over Lake Huron). The three most recent objects remain a mystery, including where they came from, whether they carried surveillance equipment, and if they were balloons or other airborne craft at all.

Since last week, the government have communicated that among many of the innocent balloons flying over the US, some of them may have been Chinese spying balloons. “At least since 2018, there does seem to seem to be this broad Chinese balloon surveillance program...” said Calra Martinez Machain, a professor of political science at the University of Buffalo. The State Department also released information that the Chinese balloon surveillance operation targets 40 other countries across the globe.

## So why are we only now detecting these balloons? 
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) utilizes a radar detection system which filters out smaller objects to prevent unnecessary clutter. This filter was implemented prior to the detection of a large surveillance balloon, as well as in light of the three balloons which were recently shot down this weekend and would not have picked up any signal of the aircrafts. This shows that China are exploiting what could be defined as a vulnerability in the NORAD radar detection systems' filters. An exploit which has most likely been leveraged since 2018.
