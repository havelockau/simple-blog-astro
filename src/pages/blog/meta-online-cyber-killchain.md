## The Best Kill Chain?

Meta’s cyber kill chain is “an analytic framework that is designed to be applied to a wide range of online operations – especially those in which the targets are human. These include, but are not limited to, cyberattacks, influence operations, online fraud, human trafficking, and terrorist recruitment.”

To visualise this kill chain, I designed a diagram. The diagram below takes on the visual representation of the kill chain outlined in the Phase-based Tactical Analysis of Online Operations paper by Ben Nimmo and Eric Hutchins. The diagram also references an article by Blackberry discussing the newly produced kill chain. The Blackberry article uses the 10 phases to generalise how this kill chain operates so that it is easy to understand for readers and also to demonstrate the wide range of online operations it covers. The diagram below references both resources as I asked the question “Can this online kill chain be adapted to succeed the Lockheed Martin kill chain?”.
