## Blowing hot wind?

There has been a lot of media speculation and several narratives that surround the Chinese Hot Air Balloon fiasco that was first noticed near the start of February, 2023. Since the identification of the balloon by civilians and the government, the USA have had a strong response. But is it really that big of a deal? Is the media blowing another story out of proportion? Why is Beijing embarrassed? Find out more in this article.

The US has taken a firm stance on the existence of this Chinese hot air balloon, previously stating that they are not shooting the ballon down over safety concerns. However, that's exactly what they did. Using a LockHeed Martin F-22 Raptor - the balloon believed to contain weather measuring instruments was shot down. China says that the actions following the identificaiton of this ballon (including it's demise) were unnecessary for such a benign instrument. The US has been conflicted in how to manage the balloon, but doesn't agree with China that the balloon posseses nothing of malicious nature. Shooting down the balloon is the start of a space-defence conversation, which will involve the discussion of China's efforts such as how many other balloons exist, what their intended purpose is, and how long they have existed flying over the North American continent. We will only know through future American communication just how serious this event is, and how threatening the existence of this balloon is. 

As always,
