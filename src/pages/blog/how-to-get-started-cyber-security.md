## Getting Started

Cybersecurity is an increasingly important field in today's digital age, as the number of cyber threats continues to grow. If you're interested in learning more about cybersecurity, here are some steps to get started:

1. Familiarize yourself with basic cybersecurity concepts: Start by understanding the basics of cybersecurity, such as the types of cyber attacks, the role of antivirus software, firewalls, and encryption. Read introductory materials on these topics to build a foundation of knowledge.


2. Get hands-on experience: The best way to learn about cybersecurity is to get hands-on experience. You can do this by participating in online ethical hacking challenges and competitions, as well as by setting up a virtual lab environment where you can practice various security techniques and configurations.

3. Learn a programming language: Many cybersecurity professionals need to be able to write code in order to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. Some popular programming languages for cybersecurity include Python, Java, and C++.


```js
greeting = 'Hello World';

console.log(greeting);
```

4. Read about the latest cybersecurity trends and news: Staying up-to-date on the latest cybersecurity trends and news is important in order to understand the evolving threat landscape. It's important to realise that cybersecurity is an ongoing issue globally, and that learning about it should become apart of your lifestyle.

```js
var sites = {
    'TLDR' = https://tldr.tech/,
    'Security Week' = https://www.securityweek.com/,
    'THN' = https://thehackernews.com/,
    'Bleeping Computer' = https://thehackernews.com/
};
```

5. Get certified: Consider getting certified in a specific cybersecurity technology or framework, such as Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) or Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). This can demonstrate your expertise and help you stand out in the field.


6. Join a cybersecurity community: Finally, consider joining a cybersecurity community, either online or in person, to network with others who share your interests and to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field. Check out OWASP chapters to see if there is one in your area.


Remember, learning cybersecurity is a long-term process, and it's important to be patient and persistent in your studies. By following these steps, you can get started on your journey towards becoming a knowledgeable and successful cybersecurity professional. It's also important to remember that cybersecurity involves more than just technical skill and that to develop your understanding it should become part of your lifestyle.
